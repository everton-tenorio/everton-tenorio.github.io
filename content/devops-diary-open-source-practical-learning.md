Conceived a few weeks ago, **#DevOpsDiary** is an open-source project inspired by existing platforms, but with an exclusive focus on **#DevOps**. This is the first version of the initiative, designed to offer a practical and structured approach to learning in the field.

The goal is to learn through hands-on challenges while applying the most commonly used tools and practices in the DevOps culture, such as **automation**, **CI/CD**, **DevSecOps**, and **collaboration**. Professionals in the field are encouraged to validate existing tasks and suggest new ideas to enrich the project.
