Using shell script and the \`xurl\` library (a tool for interacting with the X API), I created a CLI to manage tweets directly from the shell. Then, aiming to improve my English skills beyond simple word-for-word reading and writing, I used Google’s generative AI model **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to translate the posts in a natural way, fostering immersive learning.

Integrated via Python, a specific prompt was designed with the original message’s lexical and semantic context in mind. This approach of using AI for language learning aligns with the concept of **Task-Based Learning (TBL)**. TBL emphasizes communication-driven learning through practical and meaningful tasks—in this case, translation and publication induce lexical and grammatical acquisition organically.

Using an **LLM** to translate tweets requires analyzing and reviewing translations, enabling learning through practical examples in real-world situations. It also introduces elements of **gamification**, where interaction through comments and likes serves as motivation, boosting engagement.

One example of how this approach can be applied is for **freelancers** who face communication barriers with international clients. By replacing the X API with platforms like **Slack**, **Teams**, or **LinkedIn**, this methodology could be adapted to translate professional messages, expanding its usefulness in various communicative contexts.
